This file is sort of a markdown test file.

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

You can include raw HTML in markdown too: <button onclick='alert("This is an example of Javascript in Markdown")'>Click me :)</button>

(Ignore the button styling. I can provide CSS for that if necessary but buttons are proabbly outside the scope of what you need for this.)
